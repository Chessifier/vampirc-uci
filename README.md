# vampirc-uci [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vampirc/vampirc-uci.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vampirc/vampirc-uci)

Vampirc UCI is a [Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) parser and
serializer. 

The UCI protocol is a way for a chess engine to communicate with a chessboard GUI, such as [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.com/).

The [Vampirc Project](https://vampirc.kejzar.si) is a chess engine and chess library suite, written in Rust. It is named for the
Slovenian grandmaster [Vasja Pirc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasja_Pirc), and, I guess, vampires? I dunno.

Vampirc UCI uses the [PEST parser](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest) to parse the UCI messages. If you want to build your own
abstractions of the protocol, the corresponding PEG grammar is available [here](https://github.com/vampirc/vampirc-uci/blob/master/res/uci.pest).

## Installing the library

To use the crate, declare a dependency on it in your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
vampire_uci = "0.5"

```

## Usage

1. Import either the `parse(..)` method or the `parse_strict(..)` method. The difference between them that is that `parse_strict(..)`
will return an `pest::error::Error` if any of the input is unrecognized or violates the rules of the PEG grammar, whereas `parse`
simply ignores it. The latter is the approach recommended by the protocol specification.

```rust
use vampirc_uci::parse;
``` 

2. Some other useful imports (for message representation):

```rust
use vampirc_uci::{UciMessage, MessageList, UciTimeControl};
```

3. Parse some input:

```rust
let messages: MessageList = parse("uci\nposition startpos moves e2e4 e7e5\ngo ponder\n");
```

4. Do something with the parsed messages:

```rust
for m in messages {
    match m {
        UciMessage::Uci => {
            // Initialize the UCI mode of the chess engine.
        }
        UciMessage::Position { startpos, fen, moves } => {
            // Set up the starting position in the engine and play the moves e2-e4 and e7-e5
        }
        UciMessage::Go { time_control, search_control } {
            if let Some(tc) = time_control {
                match tc {
                    UciTimeControl::Ponder => {
                        // Put the engine into ponder mode ("think" on opponent's time)
                    }
                    _ => {...}
                }
            }
        }
        _ => {...}
    }
}
```

5. Outputting the messages

```rust
    let msg = UciMessage::Debug(true);
    println!("{}", msg); // Outputs the "debug true" command
```

## API

The full API documentation is available at [crates.io](https://docs.rs/vampirc-uci/0.5.0/vampirc_uci/).

## Limitations

The current version 0.5.x only supports the parsing of engineâ€“bound messages. These include:
* `uci`
* `debug`
* `isready`
* `register`
* `position`
* `setoption`
* `ucinewgame`
* `stop`
* `ponderhit`
* `quit`
* `go`

Support for the rest is coming up.
